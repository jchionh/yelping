## Task 1 - Exploratory analysis

### Description

Now that you've read in the data and have familiarized yourself with what exactly are contained in the dataset, it's time to get your hands dirty and to see what kind of information is stored in the dataset. The goal of exploratory data analysis in this case will be to identify a question or a problem that is of interest to you that you think you can answer or solve with the dataset. At this phase there's no need for formal modeling and you may not even look at the entire dataset (perhaps a random sample is sufficient). Try to focus on visualizing different aspects of the data so that you can get a better understanding of the relationships between features.

With this task you want to explore the data sufficiently so that you can develop a question or problem that you want to address with the data. The question that you ask should primarily be (1) of interest to you and should be (2) answerable from the data. Your end goal for this task is to identify a question that satisfies those two criteria.

### Tips and hints

Consider how you are going to perform your basic exploratory or predictive analyses. Keep in mind that the first n entries of the data set may not be representative. You might want to think about how to sample the data using the file() function or the and readLines() function to obtain a representative sample.

### Tasks to accomplish

- Explore the relationships between different features in each data file.
- Try linking data files together and explore the relationships between features across data files.
- Identify interesting outcomes that you may want to predict as part of a prediction question / problem
- Characterize any missing data that may be present in each of the files
- Many features incorporate free-text data that may need to be parsed, summarized, or quantified in some way. What is the best way to handle these data?
